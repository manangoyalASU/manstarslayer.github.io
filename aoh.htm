  <p>Accuracy Accounting started in Seattle, Washington, as a local accounting office, in 2016. The community was so pleased with our quality that there was an article about us in the Seattle Times. This made us grow in fame and we eventually in 2018 opened up our eigth Washington State location. We were founded by Bob Edwards, who previously worked for a smaller accounting firm. Bob Edwards attneded the Hampton University.</p>
